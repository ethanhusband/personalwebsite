            Context: The Charging Problem
          </h1>

            In the rapidly growing electric vehicle industry, the importance of
            accessible and reliable charging infrastructure is vital to a
            complete transition from combustion vehicles. Charging, whether it
            be infrastructure, batteries, the capacities of chargers, is often
            cited as the biggest problem holding back electric vehicles from

            functionality includes monetisation of these chargers for venues (or
            anyone who owns a charger, essentially) and providing information

            Load Management/Balancing
          </h1>
          <div>
            One of the key problems faced in the process of expanding EV
            charging infrastructure, is the power load strained on the grid in
            doing so. Since electric vehicle chargers draw extensive amounts of
            power from the grid, most properties with multiple chargers
            installed are likely to draw more power from the grid than their
            local power company has allocated them, resulting in power outages
            (when the load drawn by the property exceeds what it is allocated,
            tripping the{' '}
            <Link

            ).
          </div>
          <div>
            This is particularly relevant for properties which intend on having
            chargers setup, but aren't primed to be a charging station, which is
            the case for many of the clients of EVUp - apartments, parking lots,
            city councils. Dynamic Load Management, also known as Dynamic Load
            Balancing, DLB or DLM, is the localised solution to this problem. It
            ensures a group of chargers won't exceed the allocated amperage of
            the property, while also ensuring each charger is fairly distributed
            an equal amount of amperage.
          </div>
          <div>
            A lot of people (including myself at first glance, being formerly
            unfamiliar with the workings of industrial circuits) initially
            assume the solution is as straight forward as taking the property
            amperage, dividing it by the number of active chargers, assigning
            that to each charger, and moving on. Basic division. However{' '}
            <span className="underline">2 major limitations</span> are faced
            that convolute the problem significantly. Believe it or not,
            considering these limitations makes the solution much more
            complicated than division.
          </div>
          <div>
            Before exploring these, I should also add that while load management
            typically concerns balancing wattage (W) drawn by devices, we will{' '}
            <span className="underline">
              assume that the chargers are in parallel

              such that they have the same voltage (V)
            </Link>{' '}
            . Since W = I*V (known as Ohm's Law, where I = amperage), an equal
            voltage enables us to simply work in terms of amps. Note this is
            likely to be the case, as almost all home circuits are run in
            parallel to prevent one broken/off appliance disrupting the whole
            circuit. This is also convenient as{' '}

            , the standard which enables us to set each charger power limits,
            also allows setting amperage limits instead.
          </div>
          <div>
            Moving on, the first limitation is the mixing of three phase and
            single phase devices at a single location. Single phase electricity
            typically involves voltage being delivered at a rate which follows a
            single sine wave (hence the term alternating current or AC power).
            The voltage oscillates from positive to negative, and in turn the
            direction of the current also periodically changes. However most
            industrial electrical grids use standard 3 phase power, where
            instead of one alternating current (AC), it delivers 3 alternating
            currents which are shifted 120Â° as to be evenly spaced and deliver 3
            times the power. See below:

              height={300}
              className="mx-auto my-4"
            />
            Note we have been discussing this problem in terms of amperage, but
            the display shows how the phases supply voltage, which might seem to
            obfuscate the problem with a new variable. But we can still ignore
            voltage for the moment, and simply move on with the knowledge that a{' '}
            <Link
              className="text-secondary"

              3 phase device looking to draw 100A will draw 100A from each phase
            </Link>
            , as an example of how amperage distribution across 3 phases works .
            This means that when allocating amperage to devices, we have to
            consider whether the allocation exceeds capacity of{' '}
            <span className="underline">any</span> of the 3 phases, rather than
            a holistic grid (at least, when any single phase chargers are also
            involved, otherwise it becomes the same).
          </div>
          <div>
            Another limitation emerges when considering devices and ports.
            Often, each charger will have a couple of ports, which have their
            own allocations. The ports themselves have a maximum capacity they
            can use to charge a car, and on top of that, the devices themselves
            usually have a circuit amperage which must not be exceeded. We see a
            solution to this is more involved than mere division, as we need to
            respect all involved capacities.
          </div>
          <div>
            One may also be considering the factor of DC and AC chargers
            currently used to charge EV's, and whether mixing these necessitates
            any other considerations. Since DC chargers convert AC power to DC
            inside the charger,

            Modelling the problem
          </h1>
          <div>
            To create a model of the problem, and therefore find a solution,
            what every model needs is a set of assumptions from which it can
            build. The model should have a set of aims, and also a set of
            restrictions/assumptions.
          </div>
          <div>
            We aim to:
            <ul className=" ml-6">
              <li>
                a) Allocate each active charging port the most evenly
                distributed amount of amperage
              </li>
              <li>
                b) Allocate each active charging port a maximal amount of
                amperage
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            Then the corresponding restrictions/assumptions on that aim are:
            <ul className="ml-6">
              <li>
                i) Chargers and ports within chargers are connected in parallel,
                such that we may work exclusively in amperage
              </li>
              <li>
                ii) Each device has a maximal circuit amperage to not be exceed
              </li>
              <li>
                iii) Each port of a device also has a seperate maximal circuit
                amperage to not be exceeded
              </li>
              <li>
                iv) Each AC phase from the grid supplies an equal amperage
              </li>
              <li>
                v) There can be any number of devices. A device can have any
                number of ports
              </li>
              <li>vi) Every port can readily have it's maximum amperage set</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            Certainly, this is a lot to consider, and could not be satisfied by
            any naive approach. With this, my immediate idea is that we must
            also find a way to represent a given DLB setup in this model, for
            the sake of getting a better intuition and interpretation of the
            problem. The obvious initial choice is to represent this as a tree,
            since it does appear we have these 'layers' of dependency (ports
            depend on devices, devices depend on phases, vise versa).
          </div>
          <div>
            As an example, consider a Location A with 60 amps supplied from the
            grid and 3 chargers:
            <ul className="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>
                A 3 phase device with max amperage 32A, an active port with max
                amperage 20A, another active port with max amperage 32A
              </li>
              <li>
                A single phase device connected to the second phase with max
                amperage 12A, 1 active port with max amperage 10A
              </li>
              <li>
                A single phase device connected to the third phase with max
                amperage 22A, an inactive port with max amperage 15A, an active
                port with max amperage 12A.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            One should acknowledge that it is practically unlikely a charger
            will have ports with different max amperages (in fact they usually
            have the same max as the device). But we need to extend our model to
            all cases to ensure it will generalise well in the caprice of the
            real world. Nonetheless, describing Location A in the way we just
            have is in itself an example of why we need to represent this
            somehow else, writing it out is clearly far too verbose. Noting that
            phases 1, 2 and 3 are usually referred to as L1, L2, L3, that
            example could easily be represented by the following diagram:
          </div>
          <Image
            src="/assets/dlb/locationA-1.png"
            alt=""

            height={200}
            className="mx-auto"
          />
          <div>
            With this method of representing a location, therefore granting a
            data structure (the tree) with which we can represent a location, we
            can finally move on to solving this model of the problem.
          </div>
          <h1 className="text-2xl underline text-secondary">
            Solving The Model
          </h1>
          <div>
            We now need to use this tree structure to figure out what the
            optimal allocation is. It should obviously involve allocating 0 amps
            to innactive chargers, but then allocating the most evenly
            distributed and maximal amount of amperage to every other charger.
          </div>
          <div>
            Surprisingly, there is a fairly primitive algorithm that works
            exceptionally well for locations with devices that have large
            capacities in proportion to grid allocation. It simply involves
            <ol className="list-decimal ml-6">
              <li>
                Finding the phase with the most active connectors attached to it
              </li>
              <li>
                Dividing the grid amperage by that number of active connectors
              </li>
              <li>
                Setting each active connector to the minimum of {'{'} that
                division result, it's port capacity, it's device capacity {'}'}.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div>This works because</div>
          <div>
            However, it can result in large amounts of unallocated amperage if
            the device and connector capacity is far lower than what it was
            allocated, then we would have to reiterate using amount allocated
            that wasn't used, etc - getting quite messy to be optimal.
