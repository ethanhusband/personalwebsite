            known as the Mandelbrot Set, which was used as the background image
            for this website. The details of how this project are implemented
            will unfortunately require an understanding of React, but it doesn't
            mean you can't appreciate the Mandelbrot Set.

            While somewhat of an ironic project given this is the type of
            rendering React is clearly not optimised for, this provides a means
            for React developers to easily render a decent quality Mandelbrot
            set image without the need for learning more up-to-the-task
            libraries like OpenGL or Pillow. In the future I may invest the time
            into learning these libraries to do a proper animation.

            If you're wondering how such beautiful images get rendered simply by
            mathematics, I won't be able to do the explanation anymore justice
            than{' '}

            . For those who aren't interested in the mathematical details, it
            repeatedly applies a specific function (f(z) = zÂ² + c, if you were
            interested) to all points in a plane (in particular the complex
            plane) and those which diverge to become infinitely large are
            coloured differently to those that don't - depicting the Mandelbrot
            Set.
          </div>
          <div>
            As for how this is done in React, the implementation itself is at{' '}

            , there is also a raw html render in the root directory. To render
            the points it uses the{' '}
            <SiteLink href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">
              HTML Canvas component
            </SiteLink>
            . The details of how canvas elements work are somewhat necessary to
            fully understand how this works. The component defines a 'draw'
            function which takes the current frame and canvas reference to
            modify the actual graphics on the screen - by applying the
            Mandelbrot function to each graphical point many times. In order to
            actually animate the set and zoom in somewhere, we use a useEffect
            which is called each time we draw, therefore repeating the process
            and calling a render function inside each time. Do note that the
            animation is extremely slow - as I said this is something React is
            not optimised for.

            Some of the final product renders can be seen below. The first one
            is actually not quite the Mandelbrot Set, and something I rendered
            by accident when I implemented the Mandelbrot logic incorrectly -
            making it unique (as far as I can tell, probably not though) but I
            find that quite poetic. If you wish to do a render yourself, modify
            the "const dx" and "const dy" lines to zoom in on particular areas.
            I've labelled some interesting points above those lines. To be frank
            though, I'd advise just using the HTML render, it's less gimmicky
            and probably faster.
